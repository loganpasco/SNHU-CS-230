# CS230 - Operting Systems 
## Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

### The Gaming Room was a fictional client requesting help deploying their existing android game Draw it or Lose it as a web application across multiple platforms. The Gaming Room    requested that:

+ Game will have the ability to have one or more teams involved.

+ Each team will have multiple players assigned to it.

+ Game and team names must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a team name.

+ Only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time. This can be accomplished by creating unique identifiers for each instance of a game, team, or player.

## What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

### I did a good job following the design constraints and identifying a framework that could be an excellent solution to the problem of developing for different platforms in one place.

## What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

### When writing the code, using the UML diagram helped a lot. By constantly updating and referring back to the style sheet, it helped with the organization of the project.    
## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

### I would revise the software evaluation section. At times I felt confused or misunderstood what I was being asked to do.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

### I used the client requests to make design decisions. I also try to ensure the application has the essential quality of life standards, such as running smoothly and being easy to understand. If the client's request had been for a specific platform, the development considerations would have changed because the client requested a multiplatform design.

## How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

### I would examine the company’s request and then research what to expect from the design constraints of such a task. It is essential to understand the physical resource requirements on the client and server side and then develop a design to work for the particular case.
